  <p>Homeland is the only love free of impurities. The love of Syria is implanted in our hearts and was not manufactured. The homeland does not change, even if we change, it remains and we are fleeting.<br> My homeland, for whom I have a passion for someone other than you, so I adore him, for whom I sing, and for whom I have a longing for someone other than you, and I miss him, Syria. Syria is the place we love, it is the place our feet may leave but our hearts remain</p>

        <p>What is the reason for the outbreak of war in Syria?The events of the Syrian crisis began in mid-March 2011 when demonstrations took place in several Syrian cities demanding the release of freedoms, the release of political detainees from prisons, and the lifting of the state of emergency. Then, with time, the ceiling of demands gradually increased until it reached the complete overthrow of Bashar al-Assadâ€™s regime.</p>

    <p>What country is fighting Syria?
Iran has been an ally of the Syrian state in the region for some time, especially after the rise of the Guardianship of the Jurist regime in Iran and then the absolute rule of the Assad family in Syria. Iran has provided significant support to the Syrian regime in the civil war by providing the Syrian army with technical and financial support, in addition to fighters and mercenaries.</p>
